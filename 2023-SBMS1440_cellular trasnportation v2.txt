Biological membrane defines boundaries of
cells and organelles
▪ Biological membranes consist of a mosaic of proteins in a fluid lipid bilayer
▪ These membrane proteins and lipids are amphipathic, forming up
permeability barriers of cells and organelles

– Polar, Hydrophilic
– Non-polar, Hydrophobic
– Polar, Hydrophilic

Transport is central to cell function
▪ Selective transport is a
central aspect of cell
function.

▪ Specific molecules and ions
need to be selectively
moved into and out of the
cell or organelles.
▪ Overcoming the
permeability barrier of cell
membranes is crucial to
proper functioning of the
cell.

Simple diffusion
Facilitated diffusion
Active transport

Solutes cross membranes by three
mechanisms
• Solutes cross membranes by simple diffusion, facilitated
diffusion, and active transport.
• The movement of a molecule that has no net charge is
determined by its concentration gradient.

• Simple or facilitated diffusion involve exergonic movement
“down” the concentration gradient, they are passive
transport
• Active transport involves endergonic movement “up” the
concentration gradient

Simple Diffusion
❑ Simple diffusion is the unassisted movement of a solute
from higher to lower concentration, toward equilibrium.
❑ Typically, this is only possible for gases, nonpolar molecules,
or small polar molecules such as water, glycerol, or ethanol
▪

O2 and CO2

▪

Osmosis

9

Transport of O2 & CO2 by erythrocytes
▪ Erythrocytes take up oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen concentration is
high; and release it in the body tissues, where oxygen concentration is low
▪ At the same time, erythrocytes take up carbon dioxide in the body
tissues, and release it in the lungs, following the concentration gradient.
▪ Oxygen and carbon dioxide gas traverses the lipid bilayer readily by
simple diffusion

Osmosis
▪

Water molecules are uncharged; water
concentration is appreciably equal on
opposite sides of a membrane

▪

Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a
selectively permeable membrane

▪

If two solutions are separated by a
selectively permeable membrane,
permeable to the water but not the solutes,
the water will move toward the region of
higher solute concentration. This movement
is called osmosis

▪

Diffusion of solute

Osmosis

For most cells, water tends to move inward

Figure 8-4, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

11

Osmotic pressure
Osmotic pressure is the minimum pressure which needs to be applied to a solution to
prevent the inward flow of water across a semipermeable membrane.

Facilitated diffusion by transport proteins
• Transport proteins are large, integral membrane
proteins with multiple transmembrane segments,
providing a path through the lipid bilayer, allowing the
“downhill” movement of a polar or charged solute
• Carrier proteins

• Channel proteins

14

Carrier Proteins
Carrier proteins are analogous to enzymes
❑ The carrier-facilitated diffusion involves binding of a carrier protein and a specific
substrate (s) on a specific solute binding site, to form a carrier-solute intermediate
❑ A carrier protein is allosteric protein and alternates between two conformational
states
❑ Carrier proteins (transporters or permeases) bind solute molecules on one side of a
membrane, undergo a conformation change, and release the solute on the other
side of the membrane
❑ After conformational change, the “product” is released (the transported solute)
❑ Carrier proteins can become saturated as the concentration of the solute rises; the
transport by Carrier protein is reversible
❑ Carrier proteins are regulated by external factors
❑ Competitive inhibition of carrier proteins can occur in the presence of molecules
or ions that are structurally related to the correct substrate
15

Different carrier proteins
•

•

•

•

A carrier protein that transports a single solute across the membrane is
called a uniporter
When two solutes are transported simultaneously, and their transport is
coupled, the process is called coupled transport
Transporters that transfer
two solutes across a
membrane in the same
direction, are referred to
as symporters
Transporters that transfer
two solutes across a
membrane in the same
direction, are referred to
as antiporters

Figure 8-6, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

16

The erythrocyte glucose transporter
(GLUT1) is a uniport carrier for glucose

Glucose transporter (GLUT; GLUT1 in erythrocytes)
Figure 8-7, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

17

Transport by GLUT1 is reversible
• A carrier protein can facilitate transport in either
direction
• The direction of transport is dictated by the relative
solute concentrations outside and inside the cell
• Glucose concentration is kept low inside in
erythrocyte and most other animal cells
18

The erythrocyte anion exchange protein:
an antiport carrier
•
•
•

The anion exchange protein (also called the chloride-bicarbonate
exchanger) facilitates reciprocal exchange of Cl– and HCO3– ions only
The ions are exchanged in a strict 1:1 ratio
Exchange will stop if either anion is absent

19

Biological relevance of anion exchange
•

•

•
•

In tissues, waste CO2 diffuses into
the erythrocytes where it is
converted to HCO3– by the enzyme
carbonic anhydrase
As the concentration of bicarbonate
rises it moves out of the cell,
coupled with uptake of Cl– to
prevent a net charge imbalance
In the lungs, the entire process is
reversed
The chloride shift regulates pH in
erythrocytes, which further regulate
the affinity of hemoglobin for
oxygen.

In tissues

In lung

20

Channels
•

Channel proteins form hydrophilic transmembrane channels through the
membrane, to provide a passage route for specific solutes to cross the
membrane directly

•

There are three types of channels: ion channels, porins, and aquaporins

•

Some channels are large and nonspecific,
–

such as the pores on the outer membranes of bacteria, mitchondria, and
chloroplasts

–

They are formed by multipass transmembrane proteins called porins that allow
passage of solutes up to a certain size (600D)

•

Most channels are smaller and highly selective.

•

The movement of solutes through channels is much faster than transport
by carrier proteins. This is likely because conformation changes are not
required.

21

Structure of porins
•

The transmembrane segments of porins cross the membrane as b barrels

•

The b barrel has a water-filled pore at its center

•

Polar side chains line the inside of the pore, allowing passage of many
hydrophilic solutes (non-specific)

•

The outside of the barrel contains many nonpolar side chains that interact with
the hydrophobic interior of the membrane

•

They are present in the outer membrane of bacteria, mitochondria, and
chloroplasts.

Figure 8-8, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

22

Aquaporin structure
•

All aquaporins are tetrameric integral
membrane proteins

•

Four identical monomers associate with their
transmembrane segments to form four central
channels

•

The “channels”, lined with hydrophilic side
chains, are just large enough for water
molecules to pass through one at a time

•

It was present in kidney tubules and red blood
cells.

•

Genetic defects involving aquaporin genes
have been associated with several human
kidney diseases.

Figure 8-9, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

23

Ion channels
•

Smaller channels that are involved in ion transport are called ion
channels

•

Ion channels are transmembrane proteins that form with tiny
pores lined with hydrophilic atoms

•

They are remarkably selective. Most allow passage of just one
type of ions. there are separate proteins needed to transport
Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl–, etc.

•

Selectivity is based on both binding sites involving amino acid
side chains, and a size filter

•

They allow rapid passage of specific Ions

24

Gated channels
• Most ion channels are gated, meaning that they open
and close in response to some signals
- Voltage-gated channels open and close in response to
changes in membrane potential

- Ligand-gated channels are triggered by the binding of certain
substances to the channel protein
- Mechanosensitive channels respond to mechanical forces
acting on the membrane
25

Functions of ion channels
• Ion channels play roles in many types of cellular
communication, such as muscle contraction and electrical
signaling of nerve cells
• Ion channels are also needed for maintaining salt balance in
cells and airways linking the lungs
– A chloride ion channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR), helps maintain the proper Cl–
concentration in lungs; defects in the protein cause cystic fibrosis

26

Ion channels mediate neural transmission

Active Transport
❑ Active transport refers protein-mediated
endergonic movement against the gradient,
away from equilibrium.

▪

General aspects of active transport
▪
▪
▪

▪
▪

Energy requirement
Directionality
Functional importance

Direct vs. indirect active transport
Examples of active transport
▪
▪

Na+/K+ ATPase
Na+/glucose symporter
28

Active transport needs energy and
is unidirectional
•

Active transport requires energy (such as from ATP hydrolysis) to
move substances against their concentration gradients. Hence, many
membrane proteins involved in active transport are called pumps.

•

Active transport has an intrinsic directionality and is unidirectional.

•

Active transport allows the creation and maintenance of an internal
cellular environment that differs greatly from the surrounding
environment
- Uptake of essential nutrients
- Removal of wastes
- Maintenance of nonequilibrium concentrations of certain ions

29

Direct active transport
•

Direct active transport (or primary active transport): the
accumulation of solute molecules on one side of the membrane is
coupled directly to an exergonic chemical reaction (such as ATP or
GTP hydrolysis)

•

Transport proteins driven by ATP hydrolysis are called transport
ATPases or ATPase pumps, such as Na+/K+ ATPase.

• Four types of transport ATPases have been identified. They differ in
structure, mechanism, location, and roles
-

P-type (e.g. Na+/K+ ATPase )
V-type
F-type
ABC-type
30

Membrane potential
In a typical animal cell,

[K+]inside/[K+]outside = 35:1
[Na+]inside/[Na+]outside = 0.08:1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_potential

31

The Na+/K+ Pump
(direct active transport)

•

The Na+/K+ ATPase (or pump), uses hydrolysis of ATP to drive the
transport of Na+ and K+ ions. This is responsible for the asymmetric
distribution of ions across the plasma membrane of animal cells

32

Structure and allosteric feature of
the Na+/K+ ATPase
▪

The pump is a tetrameric transmembrane
protein with two a and two b subunits

▪

The a subunits contain binding sites for
3 Na+ and 1 ATP on the cytoplasmic side,
and 2 K+ on the external side

▪

3 Na+ are moved out and 2 K+ moved in
per molecule of ATP hydrolysed.

Figure 8-11, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

33

▪
▪
▪

The Na+/K+ pump has two alternative conformational states, E1 and E2
The E1 conformation is open to the inside of the cell and has high affinity for Na+ ions
The E2 conformation is open to the outside of the cell and has high affinity for K+ ions

35

Indirect active transport
Indirect active transport relies on the simultaneous transport of two
solutes. Favorable movement of one solute down its gradient drives the
unfavorable movement of the other up its gradient
Direct vs. Indirect Active Transport

Figure 8-9, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

36

Indirect active transport is driven by
ion gradients
•

Most cells continuously pump either sodium ions or protons out of the cell.
(such as the Na+/K+ pump).

•

This Na+ or H + Ion gradients can be used for both export (antiport) as well
as import (symport) of other ions.

•

Animals use the Na+ gradients for indirect transportation. The high
extracellular concentration of Na+ causes their simultaneous inward
movement down their gradients, which is a driving force for the uptake of
sugars and amino acids.

•

Most other organisms (such as fungi and plants) rely on proton gradients

•

This is indirectly related to ATP because the Na+ or proton gradients is
maintained by pump driven by ATP hydrolysis.
37

Na+/glucose symporter
(indirect active transport)
▪

Although most glucose into and out of
our cells occurs by facilitated diffusion
(such as GLUT1), some cells use a
Na+/glucose symporter

▪

The cells lining the intestine take up
glucose and some amino acids even
when their concentrations are much
lower outside than inside the cells
(against gradient)
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000629521500578X

▪

The proteins responsible for sodium symport are sodium-dependent glucose
transporters (or sodium-glucose linked transporter, SGLT)

▪

A steep Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane (maintained via the Na+/K+ pump)
provides the energy.

ER is involved in the biosynthesis
• Smooth ER is involved in lipid synthesis
– In eukaryotic cells the ER is the primary source of membrane lipids
– Smooth ER is also involved in drug detoxification, carbohydrate
metabolism, calcium storage, and steroid siosynthesis.

• Rough ER is involved in the protein synthesis and
processing.
‒ Ribosomes on the rough ER membrane synthesize both membranebound and soluble proteins
‒ The processing process in rough ER include folding of polypeptides,
assembly of multimeric protein complexes, and recognition and
removal of misfolded proteins
43

Protein trafficking
• Proteins synthesized in the rough ER must be directed to a
variety of locations by transport vesicles
– Catalase, hydrolases, peptide hormone, receptor

• Each protein contains a specific “tag,” targeting it to a transport
vesicle that will take it to the correct location
• Depending on the protein and destination, a tag may be an
amino acid sequence, a hydrophobic domain, or
oligosaccharide side chain, or some other features

44

The Golgi complex for protein processing
• Golgi complex functions for processing and packaging
secretory proteins, and complex polysaccharide synthesis.
• The protein contents of vesicles from the rough ER are
modified and processed in the Golgi complex, such as with
glycosylation.

45

Secretory pathways
•

Secretory pathways move proteins from the rough ER
through the Golgi complex to secretory vesicles or granules

•

Animal cells secrete hormones, mucus, milk proteins, and
digestive enzymes this way

•

Plant and fungal cells secrete enzyme and structural proteins
for the cell wall

46

The process of exocytosis
1.

Vesicles containing products for secretion
move to the cell surface

2.

The membrane of the vesicle fuses with
the plasma membrane

3.

Fusion with the plasma membrane
discharges the contents of the vesicle

4.

The membrane of the vesicle becomes
part of the cell membrane

Example

Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

In pancreatic β-cells, glucose intake leads to the generation of ATP
Subsequently close ATP-sensitive K+-channels.
This causes membrane depolarisation
Voltage-gated Ca2+-channels will open and permit Ca2+ entry
The increased intracellular Ca2+ triggers insulin secretion.

Exocytosis
❑ In exocytosis, proteins in a vesicle are released to the exterior of the
cell as the vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane

49
Figure 12-8, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

Endocytosis
❑ Endocytosis, the process by which cells internalize external materials

50
Figure 12-8, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

Receptor-mediated endocytosis
• Cells acquire some substances by receptor-mediated
endocytosis (or clathrin-dependent endocytosis)
• Cells use receptors on the outer cell surface to
internalize many macromolecules

• Mammalian cells can ingest hormones, growth
factors, serum proteins, enzymes, cholesterol,
antibodies, viruses, bacterial toxins
51

Process of receptor-mediated endocytosis
❖

The endocytosis process is very rapid and coated pits can be very numerous in cells

Figure 12-16, Becker’s World of the Cell, Eighth Edition

52

After internalization …
•
•
•

Clathrin coat will be dissembled and recycled
Uncoated vesicles fuse with vesicles budding from the trans-Golgi network
(TGN) to form early endosomes (pH 6-6.5).
Early endosomes continue to acquire lysosomal proteins from the TGN and
mature to form late endosomes (pH 5-5.5).
– As the endosome matures, The pH gradually lowers, facilitated
by an ATP-dependent proton pump.
– The lower pH dissociates ligands and receptors, allowing receptors to be
returned to the membrane
2. Recycle receptor
1. Recycle clathrin coat

Late endosomes eventually
develop into lysosomes (pH 4.5-5).

Coated vesicles and coat proteins
•

Most vesicles in protein and lipid transport are called coated
vesicles

•

The type of coat protein on a vesicle helps to determine the
destination of the vesicle
–
–
–
–

COPII-coated vesicles have a role in transport from the ER to the Golgi
COPI-coated vesicles are involved in retrograde transport from the Golgi
back to the ER.
Clathrin-coated vesicles are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis
Caveolin-coated vesicles are caveolae are involved in Clathrinindependent endocytosis

55

Membrane Trafficking

▪ “Tag” & signal peptide in cargo proteins targeting it to a
transport vesicle
▪ Vesicles are bound by single membrane
▪ Vesicles have specific membrane proteins as their identity
▪ Movement of vesicles rely on microtubules

Signal for protein targeting
Signal and receptor: Each targeting process needs a “address label”—
peptide sequence on the protein to tell where this protein goes. A
receptor/machinery needs to recognize that “label/signal” and deliver the
protein to the right place.
The signal peptide is often a hydrophobic stretch of 20-40 amino acids at
the N-terminus of the protein. Cleaved after translocation into ER or other
target organelles.

▪ Osmosis is the primary mechanism of H2O transport across all
biological membranes.
▪ Facilitated diffusion of H2O relies on aquaporins. They facilitate
rapid, highly selective water transport, such as that in kidney,
thus allowing the cell to regulate its volume and internal
osmotic pressure.
